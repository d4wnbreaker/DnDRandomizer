# DnDRandomizer
A world-building randomizer with a myriad of options by @d4wnbreaker

Tailor-made for the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons, you can now randomized your whole world-building
or just randomize things that you aren't much interested in creating during an adventure. Do you want to
randomize a village with 20 NPCs? Done. Do you want to randomize a whole country and then just place there
your homebrew NPCs? Totally possible. DNDRandomizer is your ultimate solution for all your world-building
problems.

All of it is done within the tables provided from the Dungeon Master's Guide 5th Edition.
