How to use it:
  - Download the ZIP file and extract it.
  - On Windows, use Shift+Right Click inside the folder and choose "Open a Terminal Window here"
  - type "java DNDR" without the quotes
  - Follow the instructions
  
The option to open a Terminal window directly from a folder doesn't exist on Macs (that I know of), so you have to use the 
terminal commands for the Mac to point the Terminal to where the files are, and then use "java DNDR" without the quotes.
